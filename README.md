## Problem definition

My client runs an Italian restaurant in Karuizawa. The restaurant staff uses handwritten slips for recording orders and accounting. However, 

However, physical slips are hard to trace 


leading to problems including curriculation and order mistakes.
The handwritten is sometimes too dirty to recognize the number and . 
The mistakes led to a negative reputation and the number of customers decreased, so they considered introducing a new online system, but they gave up since the system was too complicated for them to record
as quickly as to recode with handwritten slips. He has another problem his handwritten records of finance information are leaked by one of stuffs as he just left on a table in the office.　（See evidence of consultation in the Appendix, A )
